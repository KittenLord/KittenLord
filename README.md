Hey, I am KittenLord, I am 17, am from Ukraine, and know some C#.

Apart from coding I like to draw and make music, which is surprisingly useful when making (or rather trying to make) games

I really should learn more languages which are actually useful (apart from the goddamn c#/unity)

So that's it, maybe I'll add more contacts here later
