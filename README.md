Hey, I am KittenLord, I am 15, am from Ukraine, and know quite some shit about C#

Apart from coding I like to draw sometimes and make music, which is surprisingly useful when making (trying to make) games

I really should learn more languages which are actually useful (apart from the goddamn c#/unity)

So that's it, maybe I'll leave contacts like youtube here later
