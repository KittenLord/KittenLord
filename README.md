Although it is not unjust to call various "you-can-just-do-things"-isms overused, bland, and, especially these days,
lacking any sincere meaning altogether, rather being a spoiled symbol of a symbol, I believe that the actual words -
the actual idea here - isn't conveyed to people all too well. Humanity takes so much pride in our freedom of choice,
yet so many people fail to even imagine applying it to practice. Becoming so accustomed to suffering in the state of
affairs as to not even think of sudden, stupidly brave, naive and spontaneous, but oh so desired action. Becoming so
complacent in our own perceived weakness and incapability as to not even consider irrationally taking the path of more
resistance, let alone the *most*. And we are so overcome with fearful awe in front of others' great achievements that
we forget that those humans are no different from us. They too had to do leaps of faith of their own, and who cares if
they were dumb and destined to fail? Inadvertently, we hope that there exists some magic that, once we're taught it,
will allow us to much easily fulfill our ambitions. We hope that there exist secrets that maliciously prevent us from
achieving greatness, and only when the path is fully cleared of thorns it becomes reasonable to start putting effort.
But the truth is much simpler than that. There is no magic. There are no secrets.
